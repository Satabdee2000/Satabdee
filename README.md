This code is regarding the fraud detection using certain features like type,amount,nameOrg,oldbalanceOrg,nameDest thus predicting that it is fraud or not.
Steps used:Data reading,data cleaning,data analysis,encoding,input/output creation,train test split, machine learning modelling,prediction using x-test and at last checking the accuracy.
In data analysis,I used diiferent graphs like kdeplot,distplot,displot to show different features of the dataset.
Correlation maps used to show the most correlated graph affecting the output of the dataset.
Obtaining the confusion matrix and accuracy.
